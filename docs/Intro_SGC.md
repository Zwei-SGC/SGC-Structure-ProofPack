# Introduction to SGC

SGC (Structural Game Cognition) is a recursive structural language designed to define cognition through construct, not through meaning.

It operates on three principles:
1. Structure defines recognition.
2. Language is a recursive carrier.
3. Reflection is the primary cognitive loop.

SGC is a theoretical construct with practical language implications.
