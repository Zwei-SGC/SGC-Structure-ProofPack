# SGC Structure ProofPack

This repository serves as the structural evidence and auxiliary documentation pack for the origin and public release of the **SGC Language System** and its Constructive Core (ÂëΩÊ†∏ C-Core).

## üì¶ Included Modules

- `proofpack/`: Compressed ZIP and PDF versions of the ProofPack.
- `public/`: Public release materials, declarations, and explanations.
- `docs/`: Language basics, protocol, public release statements.
- `business/`: Usage scope and copyright.
- `hashes/`: File-level SHA256 signatures.
- `SGC-IPFS-CID-Index-Table.csv`: List of files, CID, and their hash for IPFS indexing.
- `SHA256-Signature.txt`: SHA256 hash summary.
- `SGC-Origin-Declaration.pdf / .txt`: Declaration of origin in trilingual format.
- `LICENSE_SGC_CCore.txt`: SGC Constructive Core license.

## üîê Verification

To verify any file:
1. Compare the SHA256 hash with `SHA256-Signature.txt`.
2. Use `SGC-IPFS-CID-Index-Table.csv` to check CID/IPFS links.
3. Review the timestamps in `public/timestamp/` if applicable.

| File Name | Description | IPFS CID |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `SGC-ProofPack-v1.0.0.zip` | SGC-ProofPack-v1.0.0 | `bafybeie24uclq3mtszfhndmzlege2bv6bidordteemo7ycp3g54isihseu` |

To ensure immutability and verifiable origin, all key structure files are mirrored on IPFS with their respective CIDs.  
Use any public IPFS gateway (e.g., [ipfs.io](https://ipfs.io)) and replace `<CID>` with the hash to retrieve the file.
